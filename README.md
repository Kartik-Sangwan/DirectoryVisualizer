# DirectoryVisualizer

A PYTHON PROGRAM THAT GENERATES AN INTERACTIVE SPACE MAP FOR VISUALIZATION OF YOUR FILE SYSTEM 
• The program generates a visual depiction of the amount of space files/directories occupy relative to the parent folder. The underlying data structures are Trees and
recursive technique was used in-order to iterate over the directories.
• There is also functionality in which the user can change file locations, open/close files, insert/delete files all in the graphical user interface of the program that was 
developed using pyGame.
• The major benefit of the program is analysing large file directories and figuring out just by looking at the space graph which directories are using most space.
